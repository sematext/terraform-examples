# Sematext Cloud - Terraform Deployment Examples

This repo contains some examples of using Terraform scripting to deploy [Sematext Cloud](https://sematext.com/cloud/)) APM Agent in various scenarios.

Refer to individual README.md in each example.

Most of the examples assume you already have a monitoring app set up in into your cloud account [Sematext Cloud Account](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/account/api and have an app-token.

### Getting Started

Refer to the README.md in each example for detail.


### Authentication

Some of the TF examples talk to the Sematext Clound and require a Sematext API Access token to function. You can find this by logging into your [Sematext Cloud Account](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/account/api)
